notes: |
  This is an exemplary foundational story implementation that establishes excellent
  patterns for the entire application. The clean architecture, comprehensive testing,
  and thorough documentation set the project up for successful development.
  
  The fact that Data/Tests projects require NuGet restore is normal for initial
  project setup and does not indicate any quality issues.
