# Epic 04: Building Data Import

## Epic Goal
Implement GDAL integration and building data import capabilities to load Lantmäteriet/OSM building footprints with height information for shadow calculation purposes.

## Epic Description

**Data Context:**
- Lantmäteriet provides building footprint data in .gpkg format
- OSM building data available as backup/supplementary source
- Building heights needed for 2.5D shadow calculations
- Height estimation using floor count heuristics when precise data unavailable

**Technical Requirements:**
- GDAL integration for geospatial data processing
- Building footprint geometry processing
- Height calculation and estimation algorithms
- Efficient bulk data loading procedures

## User Stories

### Story 4.1: GDAL Integration Setup
**As a** developer **I want** GDAL tools integrated into the application **so that** I can process geospatial data files efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] GDAL libraries installed and configured for .NET
- [ ] Command-line GDAL tools available (ogr2ogr, ogrinfo)
- [ ] .NET wrapper or direct GDAL integration implemented
- [ ] Support for reading .gpkg (GeoPackage) files
- [ ] Support for GeoJSON format processing
- [ ] Error handling for corrupted or invalid spatial data
- [ ] Documentation for GDAL setup and usage

### Story 4.2: Building Footprint Data Processing
**As a** developer **I want** to process building footprint geometries **so that** I can store accurate building shapes for shadow calculations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Read building polygon geometries from .gpkg files
- [ ] Validate and clean polygon data (remove invalid geometries)
- [ ] Transform coordinate systems to project standard (WGS84)
- [ ] Simplify complex polygons for performance optimization
- [ ] Handle multi-polygon buildings appropriately
- [ ] Generate unique building identifiers
- [ ] Store processed geometries in PostGIS format

### Story 4.3: Building Height Processing
**As a** developer **I want** to extract and estimate building heights **so that** shadow calculations can account for 3D building volumes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Extract height data from source files when available
- [ ] Extract floor count data for height estimation
- [ ] Implement floor-to-height conversion (floors × 3.5m default)
- [ ] Height validation and outlier detection
- [ ] Default height assignment for missing data (2-story default)
- [ ] Height source tracking (surveyed|osm|heuristic)
- [ ] Building height quality scoring

### Story 4.4: Bulk Building Data Import
**As a** system administrator **I want** efficient bulk import procedures **so that** I can load complete building datasets for the Gothenburg area.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Command-line import tool for production use
- [ ] Batch processing with progress reporting
- [ ] Incremental import capabilities (add new buildings)
- [ ] Duplicate detection and handling
- [ ] Import validation and error reporting
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets
- [ ] Import rollback capabilities for failed imports

### Story 4.5: Data Quality Assessment
**As a** system administrator **I want** data quality reporting **so that** I can assess the completeness and accuracy of building data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Building coverage analysis for target area
- [ ] Height data completeness reporting
- [ ] Geometry quality assessment (valid polygons, appropriate size)
- [ ] Data source attribution tracking
- [ ] Missing data identification and reporting
- [ ] Quality dashboard for monitoring data health
- [ ] Automated data quality alerts

## Technical Dependencies
- GDAL/OGR libraries and tools
- Lantmäteriet .gpkg building data access
- PostGIS spatial database
- Large file processing capabilities

## Performance Requirements
- Import processing: 1000+ buildings per minute
- Memory efficient processing for large datasets
- Incremental loading without full reload
- Spatial indexing after import completion

## Data Requirements
- Gothenburg metropolitan area building coverage
- Minimum 80% height data completeness
- Spatial accuracy within 1-meter tolerance
- Building footprint simplification for performance

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] GDAL integration is stable and performant
- [ ] Building import handles all expected data formats
- [ ] Height estimation provides reasonable accuracy
- [ ] Import procedures are documented and reliable
- [ ] Data quality meets requirements for shadow calculations

## Success Metrics
- 95%+ import success rate for valid building data
- Height estimation accuracy within 20% for spot-checks
- Import performance meets 1000 buildings/minute target
- Data coverage includes all major Gothenburg buildings
