# Epic 06: Weather Integration & Confidence

## Epic Goal
Integrate Yr/Met.no weather API for cloud cover data and implement confidence calculation system that blends geometric accuracy with weather uncertainty.

## Epic Description

**Weather Context:**
- Yr/Met.no provides nowcast (immediate) and forecast (future) data
- Cloud cover affects sun visibility even when geometrically sunny
- Confidence calculation blends geometry quality with weather certainty
- Fallback strategies needed for API unavailability

**Technical Implementation:**
- Weather API client with rate limiting and error handling
- Cloud cover data processing and storage
- Confidence algorithm implementation
- Weather data caching and refresh strategies

## User Stories

### Story 6.1: Weather API Integration Setup
**As a** developer **I want** to integrate with Yr/Met.no weather API **so that** I can access cloud cover data for Gothenburg.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Yr/Met.no API client implemented with proper authentication
- [ ] API endpoint configuration for Gothenburg location
- [ ] HTTP client with retry logic and timeout handling
- [ ] Rate limiting compliance (respect API limits)
- [ ] Error handling for API unavailability
- [ ] API response parsing and validation
- [ ] Documentation for API setup and credential management

### Story 6.2: Cloud Cover Data Processing
**As a** developer **I want** to process and store cloud cover data **so that** I can use it for confidence calculations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Nowcast data ingestion (current cloud conditions)
- [ ] Short-term forecast data ingestion (next 4-6 hours)
- [ ] Cloud cover percentage extraction and validation
- [ ] Temporal data alignment with sun calculations
- [ ] Cloud data storage with timestamps
- [ ] Data retention policy (14 days as per PRD)
- [ ] Cloud cover interpolation for missing timestamps

### Story 6.3: Weather Data Refresh Worker
**As a** system **I want** automated weather data updates **so that** cloud information stays current for accurate confidence calculations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Background worker for periodic weather updates
- [ ] Nowcast updates every 5-10 minutes
- [ ] Forecast updates every hour
- [ ] Worker scheduling and monitoring
- [ ] Graceful handling of API failures
- [ ] Worker health checking and alerting
- [ ] Manual weather data refresh capability

### Story 6.4: Confidence Calculation Algorithm
**As a** developer **I want** to calculate confidence percentages **so that** users can assess the reliability of sun predictions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Confidence formula: `100*(0.6*geometryQuality + 0.4*cloudCertainty)`
- [ ] Geometry quality scoring based on patio data quality flags
- [ ] Cloud certainty scoring (nowcast=high, forecast=medium, missing=low)
- [ ] Confidence capping (90% max for forecast-only, 60% for estimates)
- [ ] Confidence badges: High (?70%), Medium (40-69%), Low (<40%)
- [ ] Confidence explanation tooltips for user understanding
- [ ] Confidence calculation testing and validation

### Story 6.5: Weather Fallback Strategies
**As a** system **I want** fallback strategies for weather API issues **so that** the application remains functional when weather data is unavailable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Graceful degradation when weather API is down
- [ ] Historical weather pattern fallback for estimates
- [ ] Clear user messaging when confidence is reduced
- [ ] System monitoring for weather data freshness
- [ ] Alternative weather source evaluation (backup APIs)
- [ ] Confidence adjustments for stale weather data
- [ ] Recovery procedures when weather API returns

## Technical Dependencies
- Yr/Met.no weather API access and credentials
- Background job processing framework
- HTTP client libraries with robust error handling
- Weather data storage and caching infrastructure

## Performance Requirements
- Weather API calls: Respect rate limits (typically 1000-5000 calls/day)
- Weather data refresh: Complete within 2-3 minutes
- Confidence calculation: <50ms per patio
- Weather data availability: >95% uptime

## Integration Requirements
- API key management and security
- Weather data coordinate alignment with Gothenburg bounds
- Time zone handling for weather timestamps
- Weather data quality validation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Weather API integration is stable and reliable
- [ ] Confidence calculations work as specified
- [ ] Weather data refresh runs automatically
- [ ] Fallback strategies handle API failures gracefully
- [ ] System maintains functionality during weather outages

## Success Metrics
- Weather API reliability >95% (excluding planned maintenance)
- Confidence calculation accuracy validated against real conditions
- Weather data freshness <15 minutes during normal operation
- User understanding of confidence system (measured via feedback)
